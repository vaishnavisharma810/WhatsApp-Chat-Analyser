2) Convert a Tf model to a Tflite model 
3) Integrate both python and android code by you and try to run on mobile phone / emulator.
8/11/21, 12:06 - +91 99813 29050: Hello all....
any updates on the work?üòä

8/11/21, 12:49 - Vaishnavi Sharma: I read about conversion of tf model to tflite model
8/11/21, 13:21 - Divyansh Saxena: I added a sequential layer to the pretrained yamnet model which predicts the 7 classes, but I did not get a good accuracy, so will have to work more on it.
8/11/21, 16:40 - +91 99813 29050: Have you completed running the android code using Android studio ?
8/11/21, 16:44 - +91 99813 29050: Ok what is the accuracy you are getting??
8/11/21, 16:45 - Divyansh Saxena: It is around 70%
8/11/21, 16:47 - Divyansh Saxena: I'm testing on some random data downloaded from the internet to inspect it manually
8/11/21, 16:48 - +91 99813 29050: Ok it's ok just check if you are missing something ...
 otherwise try different loss functions. And check also on standard available dataset for now once..
8/11/21, 16:49 - Divyansh Saxena: Yes I'm working on it.
8/11/21, 16:49 - Monika Hill PRISM: Yes sir i run the code in andrioid studio
8/11/21, 16:52 - +91 99813 29050: Ok great so now we have to convert the android code to a 7 class problem, so that it can detect these 7 classes in best possible way. And then we have to use the model generated by divyansh in our code.
8/18/21, 14:47 - +91 99813 29050: Hi all any updates on the work ?
8/18/21, 14:58 - Divyansh Saxena: Sir as of now, I'm trying to figure out some other way to implement the 7 class classifier in order to increase the accuracy.
